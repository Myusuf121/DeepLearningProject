But if George Mason is not in fact the best college for me, even though the person I asked was trying to help, that one opinion could sway me to go there anyway and not have the best experience. But yet if I go to ten people to advice, including the person who suggested George Mason, they might be the only one who would say that and maybe five of the other people I asked might say Virginia Tech, and I would decide to go to Virginia Tech instead of to George Mason, and I would overall be happier and maybe even get better grades. Then I would be more successful because I went to multiple people before I made a decision that could affect my entire life. So therefore even though one person still has a chance to give valid advice, it is safer to talk to multiple people because it increases the chances of making a bad decision.

When I was in second grade, I passed the test to be admitted into the AAP (Advanced Academics Program) in my school. My best friend was also accepted, and wanted me to go to AAP with her, but I didnt really want to go into AAP. I told my parents this, and they agreed it would be best for me to stay in the normal class for on more year. Since I got my parents' opinions, I also felt more secure staying out of the advanced program even though my friend wanted me to do the opposite and go into the program. And so in third grade, I was not in AAP with my best friend, but nonetheless, I was happy and met many new friends in the normal class, some of whom are still my friends today. When I went into fourth grade, however, I decided that I wanted to go into the AAP program. Since I had already gotten in a year before, I was not required to retake the test and went in smoothly to the advanced program. In this example, I sought three opinions (my parents and my best friend) in order to make a decision, but if I had taken my friend's advice alone, I would have gone into AAP in third grade and not have been as happy as I was in the regular class. This shows clearly that",Evidence,Evidence 3,576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827

4C471936CD75,1.61803E+12,4935,5825,"there are many other reasons one might want to seek multiple opinions and pieces of advice instead of just one, but these are the two main ones that I think really make it worthwhile to ask for advice from multiple people instead of making decisions with only one piece of advice from one person. The key thing that all of these examples have shown is that it is better to seek multiple opinions from multiple different people than to only get advice from one. This is ultimately because asking multiple people for advice makes you feel better about the decisions you make and also increases the chances that one or more of the people you consulted with gave you the right advice at the right time to empower you do what is right for you (or perhaps what is right for the country you happen to be in charge of!).                                                                              ",Concluding Statement,Concluding Statement 1,905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 949 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971 972 973 974 975 976 977 978 979 980 981 982 983 984 985 986 987 988 989 990 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 1000 1001 1002 1003 1004 1005 1006 1007 1008 1009 1010 1011 1012 1013 1014 1015 1016 1017 1018 1019 1020 1021 1022 1023 1024 1025 1026 1027 1028 1029 1030 1031 1032 1033 1034 1035 1036 1037 1038 1039 1040 1041 1042 1043 1044 1045 1046 1047 1048 1049 1050 1051 1052 1053 1054
